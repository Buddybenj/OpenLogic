\olsection{$\eta$-conversion}

There is another relation on $\lambda$ terms. In
\olref[lc][int][fv] we used the example $\lambd[g][\lambd[m][\times g
m]]$. If we look at it carefully it's a function that accepts two~!!{argument}s
$g$ and $m$, and applies $\times$ on them. It seems to be another
multiplication function. We use $\eta$-reduction (and $\eta$-extension) to
capture this idea.

\begin{defn}[$\eta$-reduction]
  If a term $@P$ contains an occurrence of $\lambda[@x][@M @x]$, and $@x
  \notin FV(@M)$, then replacing this occurrence by $@M$ is called \emph{$\eta$-contraction}. If $@P$ can be changed to
  $@Q$ by a finite (possibly empty) series of such steps, then we say
  $@P ~\alpha\text{-reduces to}~@Q$.
\end{defn}

\begin{prob}
  There is a notion of \emph{$\eta$-expansion} kind of symmetric to
  $eta$-reduction, define it. The title of the section,
  \emph{$\eta$-conversion} is the combination of both, define it.
\end{prob}
