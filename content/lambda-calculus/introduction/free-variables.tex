\olsection{Free Variables}

As mentioned earlier, $\lambda$-calculus is about functions, and
lambda abstraction is where functins arises. When we
write $\lambd[x][M]$, we can refer to the~!!{parameter} $x$ in $\lambd[x]$ by
occurrences of variable $x$ in $M$. $M$ is called the
scope of $\lambd[x]$, and these occurrences are said to be \emph{bound} by this
$\lambd[x]$. 

\begin{defn}[Scope]
For a particular occurrence of $\lambd[x][M]$ in a term $P$, the
occurrence of $M$ is called the \emph{scope} of the occurrence of $\lambd[x]$
on the left.
\end{defn}

\begin{prob}
  Point out scopes in this term: $\lambd[@g][(\lambd[@x][@g (@x @x)]) \lambd[@x][@g (@x @x)]]$.
\end{prob}

\begin{defn}[Bound occurrences of a variable]
  An occurrence of variable $x$ is \emph{bound} if it's in the scope of a $\lambd[x]$.
\end{defn}

\begin{ex}
  In $\lambd[@x][@x @x]$, both occurrences of $@x$ is bound by $\lambd[@x]$.
\end{ex}

\begin{prob}
  In $\lambd[@g][(\lambd[@x][@g (@x @x)]) \lambd[@x][@g (@x @x)]]$, are all
  occurrences of variables bound? By which abstractions are they
  bound recpectively?
\end{prob}

Note that not all occurrences of $x$ in the subterm necessarily refers to this particular parameter,
since there can be another but inner $\lambd[x]$, as shown in the
following example. 
\begin{ex}
In $\lambd[@x][\lambd[@x][@x]]$, while the variable $@x$ is in the
scopes of both $\lambd[@x]$, it only refers to the inner one, as one
might expect. We may say the inner abstraction shadows the outer
abstraction.
\end{ex}

We have only seen examples only using variable $x$ in the scope of $\lambd[x]$, 
what happens when we break it?
\begin{ex}
  $\lambd[@x][@x @y]$, while the occurrence of $@x$ refers to the~!!{parameter} of $\lambd[@x]$, $@y$ is not in a scope
  of any $\lambd[@y]$. 
\end{ex}

In the last example, $@y$ is called \emph{free}. 
\begin{defn}[Free occurrences of a variable]
  An occurrence of a variable $x$ in a term $P$ is \emph{free} if it's not bound, i.e., not in the scope of any
  $\lambd[x]$ in $P$.
\end{defn}


For a term $P$, we can check all variable occurrences in it and get a set of free
variables. This set is denoted by $FV(P)$ with a natural definition
as follows:

\begin{defn}[Free variables] \ollabel{def}
  The set of \emph{free variables} of a term is defined inductively by:
  \begin{align} 
    FV(x) &= \{x\} \ollabel{def:1} \\
    FV(\lambd[x][N]) &= FV(N) \setminus \{x\}    \ollabel{def:2} \\
    FV(PQ) &= FV(P) \cup FV(Q) \ollabel{def:3}
  \end{align}
\end{defn}

\begin{prob}
  Run the above definition on $\lambd[@x][(\lambd[@y][(\lambd[@z][@x @y]) @z]) @y]$
\end{prob}

\begin{explain}
A free variable is like a reference to outside world (\emph{environment}), and a term
containing free variables can be seen as a partially specified term,
since its behaviour is kind of dependent on how we setup the
environment. For example, the term $\lambd[@x][@f @x]$ which
accepts an argument and returns $f$ of that argument, refers to the environment variable
$@f$. So informally speaking this term is dependent on the environment
it's in, in particular the setting of $@f$ in that environment.

Continuing the last example, if we wrap this term by an abstraction, we get
$\lambd[@f][\lambd[@x][@f @x]]$. Now it's no longer dependent on
the environment variable $@f$, because essentially it's a function that
accepts two arguments, and returns the result of applying the first to
the second; Our changing $@f$ in the environment won't have any
effect on the behavior of this term, as the term will only use the $@f$
passed as argument anyway and not the one in environment. The term
in this case is called a \emph{closed term}.
\end{explain}

\begin{defn}[Closed term]
  A term with no free variable is a \emph{closed term}.
\end{defn}

\begin{lem}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item \ollabel{lem:abs} If $y \neq x$, then $y \in FV(\lambd[x][N])$ iff $y \in
    FV(N)$.
    \item \ollabel{lem:app} $y \in FV(PQ)$ iff $y \in FV(P)$ or
      $y \in FV(Q)$.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
  Left as exercise.
\end{proof}

\begin{prob}
  Prove \olref{lem:abs} and \olref{lem:app}.
\end{prob}
