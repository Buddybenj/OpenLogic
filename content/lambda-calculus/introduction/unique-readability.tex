\olsection{Unique Readability}

As in \olref[fol][syn][unq], for each lambda term there is only one
way to construct and interpret it. The most of the part makes
sense only if this property holds.

In the following discussion, a \emph{formation} is the procedure of
constructing a term using formation rules (one or several times), \emph{rules} is short for
formation rules. 

\begin{lem}\ollabel{lem:term-start}
  A term starts with either a variable or a parenthesis.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
  Left as exercise.
\end{proof}

\begin{lem}\ollabel{lem:app-start}
  The resulting term of APP starts with either two parenthesis or a
  parenthesis and a variable.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
  Left as exercise; you may want to use \olref{lem:term-start}.
\end{proof}

\begin{prop}[Unique Readability]
There is a unique formation for each term. In other words, if a term
$@M$ is formed by a formation, then it's the only formation that can form this term.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
  We prove this by induction on the formation of terms. 

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item[\rule{VAR}] $@M$ must be of the form
      $@x$, where $@x$ is some variable. Since the results of other two
      formations always start with parentheses, they cannot be used to
      construct $@M$; Thus, the formation of $@M$ must be a single step
      of \rule{VAR}, which is this very formation.
    \item[\rule{ABS}] $@M$ must be of the
      form $(\lambd[@x][@N])$, where $@x$ is some variable and $@N$ is a
      term constructed from rules. By I.H. we know that formation of
      $@N$ is unique. Variable couldn't have construct it
      because the result of that rule is a single variable;
      Neither could \rule{APP} because of \olref{app-start}. Thus
      this formation of $@M$, namely the unique formation of $@N$
      followed by \rule{ABS}, is unique.

    \item[\rule{APP}] $@M$ must be of the form
      $(@P@Q)$, where $@P$ and $@Q$ are terms constructed from rules. By
      I.H. we know that formations of $@P$ and $@Q$ is unique. \rule{VAR} and
      \rule{ABS} couldn't have construct it with the same reason in the 
      last case. Thus this formation of $@M$, namely the unique
      formations of $@P$ and $@Q$ followed by \rule{APP}, is unique.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{proof}

A more readable paraphrase of the above proposition is as follows:
\begin{prop}[Unique Readability (readable)]
  A term $@M$ can only be one of the following forms:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item[\rule{VAR}] $@x$, where $@x$ is a variable uniquely determined by $@M$.
    \item[\rule{ABS}] $(\lambd[@x][@N])$, where $@x$ is a variable and $@N$ is
      another term, both of which is uniquely determined by $@M$.
    \item[\rule{APP}] $(@P@Q)$, where $@P$ and $@Q$ are two terms uniquely
      determined by $@M$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{prop}
