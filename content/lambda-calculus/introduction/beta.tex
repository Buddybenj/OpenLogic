\olsection{$\beta$-reduction}

When we see $(\lambd[m][(\lambd[y][y]) m])$, it's natural to
conjecture that it has some connection with $\lambd[m][m]$,
namely the second term should be the result of ``simplifying'' the first, if
``simplify'' means anything. The $\beta$-reduction captures this
intuition formally.

\begin{defn}[$\beta$-contraction, $\bredone$] \ollabel{def}
  \emph{The $\beta$-contraction} ($\bredone$) is the smallest compatible
  relation on terms, satisfying the following condition:
  \begin{align*}
    (\lambd[x][N])Q \bredone \Subst{N}{Q}{x} 
  \end{align*}
  We say $P$ is $\beta$-contracted to $Q$ if $P \bredone Q$. 
\end{defn}

\begin{prob} \ollabel{prob:def}
  Spell out the equivalent inductive definitions of $\beta$-contraction as we
  did for Change of bound variable in \olref[alp]{def}.
\end{prob}
  
\begin{defn}[$\beta$-reduction, $\bred$] \ollabel{def}
  \emph{$\beta$-reduction} ($\bred$) is the smallest reflexive, transitive
  relation on terms containing $\bredone$.
  We say $P$ is $\beta$-reduced to $Q$ if $P \bred Q$.
\end{defn}
We will write $\redone$ instead of $\bredone$, $\red$ instead of
$\bred$ when context is clear.

Informally speaking, $M \bred N$  if and only if $M$ can be changed to
$N$ by zero or several steps of $\beta$-contraction.

\begin{defn}[$\beta$-normal]
A term that cannot be $\beta$-contracted any further is said to be
\emph{$\beta$-normal}. 
\end{defn}
If $M \bred N$ and $N$ is $\beta-normal$, then we say $N$ is normal
form of $M$. One may ask if normal form of a term is unique, and the
answer is yes, as we will see in the next chapter.

\begin{defn}[$\beta$-equivalence, $\eqb$]
  \emph{$\beta$-equivalence} ($\eqb$) is the smallest equivalence (reflexive,
  symmetric, transitive) relation containing $\bredone$.
\end{defn}
Informally speaking, two terms are $\beta$-equivalent if and only if
one of them can be changed to the other in zero or more steps of
$\beta$-contraction, or ``inverse'' of $\beta$-contraction. Inverse of
$\beta$-contraction is defined so that $M$ inverse-$\beta$-contracts to $N$
iff $N$ $\beta$-contracts to $M$.

We will write $\eq$ instead of $\eqb$ when the context is clear.

Let us consider some examples.
\begin{enumerate}
\item We have
\begin{align*}
(\lambd[x][xxy]) \lambd[z][z] & \redone (\lambd[z][z])(\lambd[z][z]) y \\
& \redone (\lambd[z][z]) y \\
& \redone y
\end{align*}
\item ``Simplifying'' a term can make it more complex:
\begin{align*}
(\lambd[x][xxy])(\lambd[x][xxy]) & \redone (\lambd[x][xxy])(\lambd[x][xxy])y \\
& \redone (\lambd[x][xxy])(\lambd[x][xxy])yy \\
& \redone \dots
\end{align*}
\item It can also leave a term unchanged:
\[
(\lambd[x][xx])(\lambd[x][xx]) \redone (\lambd[x][xx])(\lambd[x][xx])
\]
\item Also, some terms can be reduced in more than one way; for
  example,
\[
(\lambd[x][(\lambd[y][yx]) z]) v \redone (\lambd[y][yv]) z
\]
by contracting the outermost application; and
\[
(\lambd[x][(\lambd[y][yx]) z]) v \redone (\lambd[x][zx]) v
\]
by contracting the innermost one. Note, in this case, however, that
both terms further reduce to the same term, $zv$.
\end{enumerate}

The final outcome in the last example is not a coincidence, but rather
illustrates a deep and important property of the lambda calculus, known as the
``Church-Rosser property.''

\begin{digress}
  In general cases there is more than one way to $\beta$-reduce a
  term, thus many reduction strategies have been invented, among which
  the most common is \emph{natural strategy}.
  
  Natural strategy always contracts the \emph{left-most}
  redex, where the position of a redex is defined as its starting
  point in the term.

  Natural strategy has a useful property that if a term can be reduced
  to normal form by some strategy iff it can be reduced to normal form in
  natural strategy. In the rest of the text we will use natural
  reduction unless otherwise specified. 
\end{digress}
